# Expense-Tracker-App
The expense tracking app allows users to track their daily transactions by entering the amount, description, date, and category of the purchase or transaction made by the user.

This app provides a list of transactions and the remaining balance in the user's account after the transactions. It also contains features like a category analysis table and bar graph analysis of categories.

Category analysis table: It provides the total amount spent on each category and compares it with the maximum expenditure set by the user for each category.

Bar graph analysis: The bar graph is a visual description of the transactions in each category.
